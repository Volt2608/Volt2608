## 📌 Featured Project

🎓 **RAG-Based AI Teaching Assistant**  
🔗 **Project Repository:** https://github.com/Volt2608/RAG_Based_AI_Assistant

This project builds a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI assistant that helps students explore MIT OpenCourseWare Python lectures. Instead of guessing, the system retrieves exact lecture segments with timestamps and generates answers grounded strictly in course content.

The pipeline converts lecture videos to audio, transcribes them using Whisper, chunks and embeds the text with Ollama, and performs semantic similarity search to retrieve relevant segments. A lightweight LLM then produces accurate, context-aware responses or clearly refuses to answer if the question is out of scope.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end RAG workflow on unstructured data, focusing on deterministic pipelines, grounded generation, and explainable outputs.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Whisper, Ollama, Scikit-learn, Jupyter

🏠 **California Housing Price Prediction**  
🔗 **Project Repository:** https://github.com/Volt2608/CaliforniaHousingPrice

This project predicts median house prices in California using demographic, geographic, and economic features. It focuses on building a **robust end-to-end machine learning pipeline** rather than just model training.

The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, stratified sampling, and preprocessing using Scikit-learn pipelines and `ColumnTransformer`. Multiple regression models are trained and evaluated to compare performance and generalization.

The project demonstrates strong fundamentals in **data preprocessing, model evaluation, and reproducible ML workflows** suitable for real-world applications.
**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
